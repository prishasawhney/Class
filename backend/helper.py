def resumeScorerPrompt(docs, jobDescription):
    return f""" You are a highly specialized resume evaluator tasked with providing *strict, job-specific feedback* based on the *exact* job description provided. Your evaluation must emphasize precise alignment with the job description, penalizing mismatches and offering *detailed recommendations* on how to improve any deficiencies. The scoring should reflect how well the resume meets the requirements, and your feedback must provide clear, actionable suggestions for improvement.

### Job Description:
{jobDescription}

### Resume Content:
{docs}

### Evaluation Criteria with Detailed Recommendations:

#### 1. *Role Alignment (Critical)*
   - *Role Fit* (out of 100): 
     Evaluate how closely the resume aligns with the responsibilities and role outlined in the job description.
     - *Penalization Guidelines*: Penalize heavily if irrelevant roles or responsibilities dominate the resume. Deduct points for any lack of relevant experience related to the job‚Äôs specific duties.
     - *Detailed Recommendations*: 
       - *If strong alignment*: Highlight the specific experiences in the resume that demonstrate a close fit to the job. 
       - *If weak alignment*: Identify the mismatched roles or responsibilities. Provide examples of experiences that are irrelevant to the job and recommend replacing or minimizing these. Suggest adding more role-specific experiences or reframing the candidate‚Äôs responsibilities to better match the job description.

#### 2. *Skills Relevancy (Critical)*
   - *Skills Match* (out of 100): 
     Assess the resume‚Äôs skills section, focusing solely on the skills required by the job description.
     - *Penalization Guidelines*: Deduct points if key skills from the job description are missing, underrepresented, or overshadowed by unrelated skills.
     - *Detailed Recommendations*: 
       - *If strong alignment*: Mention which key skills match well and how these strengthen the resume‚Äôs alignment with the job description.
       - *If weak alignment*: Clearly identify missing critical skills from the job description and suggest specific skills the candidate should include to improve relevance. If irrelevant skills dominate, recommend downplaying or removing them, and explain how this adjustment would make the resume more focused on the job at hand.

#### 3. *Keywords and Terminology Matching*
   - *Keywords Use* (out of 100): 
     Evaluate how well the resume incorporates the keywords and phrases from the job description.
     - *Penalization Guidelines*: Penalize heavily if the resume lacks important keywords from the job description or uses terms from unrelated fields.
     - *Detailed Recommendations*: 
       - *If strong alignment*: Highlight the effective use of job-specific terminology and how it contributes to the resume‚Äôs alignment with the job.
       - *If weak alignment*: Identify critical keywords that are missing and recommend specific phrases or terminology the candidate should include. If the resume uses unrelated jargon or terminology from a different field, suggest adjusting the language to better align with the job description and industry standards.

#### 4. *Impact of Achievements*
   - *Achievements Relevance* (out of 100): 
     Analyze the relevance of the achievements in the resume and how well they reflect the impact required for the role.
     - *Penalization Guidelines*: Penalize if the achievements are unrelated to the core responsibilities or impact expected for the job. Deduct points if the accomplishments focus on tasks that do not contribute to the role's goals.
     - *Detailed Recommendations*: 
       - *If strong alignment*: Highlight specific achievements that directly relate to the job description and emphasize how they demonstrate the candidate‚Äôs ability to meet the job‚Äôs objectives.
       - *If weak alignment*: Pinpoint achievements that are irrelevant or do not match the job‚Äôs responsibilities. Suggest focusing on outcomes and accomplishments that better demonstrate the candidate‚Äôs capacity to meet the job‚Äôs demands. If necessary, recommend reframing or rewording achievements to show more relevant impact.

#### 5. *Format and Readability*
   - *Resume Style and Structure* (out of 100): 
     Evaluate the resume‚Äôs format, clarity, and overall structure, focusing on how easy it is to navigate and extract relevant information.
     - *Penalization Guidelines*: Deduct points for poor formatting, lack of clarity, or if the structure buries relevant information under unrelated content.
     - *Detailed Recommendations*: 
       - *If strong alignment*: Commend the clarity and organization of the resume and how its structure makes it easy to find relevant information.
       - *If weak alignment*: Suggest specific improvements to the resume‚Äôs format and readability. Recommend reorganizing sections to highlight relevant experiences and skills, and ensure that the most important information is easily accessible. Offer advice on improving white space, headings, and bullet points for better readability.

### Final Scoring:

- *Overall Alignment (out of 100)*: 
  Provide a final score that reflects the resume‚Äôs overall alignment with the job description. The final score should emphasize mismatches in role, skills, and keywords, even if the resume is strong for other roles.
  - *Penalization Guidelines*: Deduct substantial points for resumes that contain a significant number of irrelevant experiences, skills, or achievements. Penalize further if the resume misses essential keywords or fails to clearly communicate alignment with the job.
  - *Detailed Recommendations*: Provide a comprehensive summary of the resume‚Äôs strengths and weaknesses. Highlight what the candidate did well in aligning with the job description, and offer actionable suggestions for improvement in any areas of mismatch. Be specific about where the resume needs adjustments to better align with the job description and how the candidate can tailor their resume more effectively for this role.

### Instructions for the Model:

- Your evaluation must *strictly* adhere to the job description provided. Score based solely on how well the resume aligns with the specific requirements and expectations of the job.
- Heavily penalize resumes that contain *irrelevant experiences, skills, or achievements*. Ensure the final score reflects the job-specific relevancy, not the general quality of the resume.
- Provide *clear, detailed recommendations* for each score. Offer precise suggestions on how to improve, including specific skills, keywords, and achievements the candidate should add or adjust to better match the job description. Be explicit about what the resume lacks and how those deficiencies can be addressed.
